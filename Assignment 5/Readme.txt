Part 1:
    > Please access certGen.sh in the certificates folder. Sample keys and certificates have already been generated.

Part 2:
    > Please start server.py before starting client.py.
    > The server fetches its own IP through 'socket.gethostbyname()'. It's port, however, is hardcoded on line 9 in server.py(can be changed).
    > The client program asks for input of server IP and port, once client.py has been started. These will already have been printed on the server's terminal.
    > Both programs will terminate once the server has replied to the client with the sum.
